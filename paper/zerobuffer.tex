\section{Zero Buffer Semantics}
The circular dependency and the orphaned receive patterns may also cause a program deadlock under zero buffer semantics. Notice that the rules in \figref{fig:machine} are consistent with how messages communicate under infinite buffer semantics (e.g., a send is issued immediately). 
The zero buffer semantics, however, use a different way of message communication. 
Therefore, a schedule validated by the function \textrm{VALIDATE} in \algoref{algo:main} may not be feasible for zero buffer. 

To check if the programs may deadlock for the circular dependency or the orphaned receive under zero buffer semantics, the zero buffer compatibility \cite{HuangNFM15} should be checked with two modifications to the validation methods: 1) the encoding rules for zero buffer semantics \cite{HuangNFM15} are added to the function $\mathrm{ENCODE}$ in \algoref{algo:vorphaned}; 2) The circular dependency pattern requires the same SMT encoding function for validating the instances.
