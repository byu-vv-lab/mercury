\section{Zero Buffer Semantics}
The circular dependency and the orphaned receive for infinite buffer semantics are discussed in section 4 and 5, respectively. The two patterns may also cause a program deadlock under zero buffer semantics. Notice that the rules in \figref{fig:machine} are consistent with how messages communicate under infinite buffer semantics (e.g., a send is issued immediately). 
The zero buffer semantics, however, use a different way of message communication. 
Therefore, a schedule validated by the function \textrm{VALIDATE} in \algoref{algo:main} may not be feasible for zero buffer semantics. 

To check if a program may deadlock for the circular dependency or the orphaned receive under zero buffer semantics, the zero buffer compatibility \cite{HuangNFM15} should be checked with two modifications to the validation. 
First, the function $\mathrm{ENCODE}$ in \algoref{algo:vorphaned} is extended to support zero buffer semantics based on the encoding rules in \cite{HuangNFM15}. This change ensures that a satisfying assignment of the encoding represents a schedule that is compatible with zero buffer semantics for an orphaned receive pattern instance.
Second, the validation for the circular dependency is modified to use the same SMT encoding to check the feasibility of a CTP generated by the abstract machine. This is because a deadlock for a circular dependency pattern instance under zero buffer semantics requires a zero buffer compatible schedule.
