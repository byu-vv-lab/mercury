\section{Zero Buffer Semantics}
The deadlock patterns discussed above may also cause a program to deadlock under zero buffer semantics. Notice that the commands in \figref{fig:machine} are consistent with how messages communicate under infinite buffer semantics (e.g., a send is consumed immediately). The zero buffer semantics, however, enforce a different way of message communication. As such, a feasible infinite buffer schedule generated by \algoref{algo:main} is not able to witness a deadlock under zero buffer semantics. Therefore, the zero buffer compatibility should be checked for each generated schedule. \algoref{algo:main} is extended with two changes: 1) the zero buffer encoding rules (refer to \cite{HuangNFM15}) are added to the function $\mathrm{ENCODE}$; 2) The circular dependency pattern also needs an SMT encoding to check the feasibility of a schedule. As a note, to encode the match pairs for the circular dependency pattern only needs to ensure that each receive in the schedule is matched with some send. Once the schedule is proved to be zero buffer compatible, the program may deadlock under zero buffer semantics; otherwise, the pattern instance does not imply a real deadlock.
