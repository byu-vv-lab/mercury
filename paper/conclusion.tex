\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This presentation presents a new algorithm that first detects the potential deadlock pattern instances and then detects a real deadlock by pruning from these instances.
The key insight in this presentation is the abstract machine that prunes provably non-feasible schedules by simply counting the issued sends and issued receives. 
This presentation further defines two types of deadlock patterns: circular dependency and orphaned receive, and their validation. The circular dependency uses simple rules for validation. The orphaned receive, however, requires a higher cost SMT encoding from existing work. This presentation additionally proves that the algorithm is sound and complete for the circular dependency pattern and the orphaned receive pattern.
Further, the algorithm can be modified to check deadlocks for these two patterns under zero buffer semantics. Experiments demonstrate that the algorithm in this presentation is able to detect all the deadlocks in a typical set of benchmarks and is more efficient than two state-of-art MPI verifiers.

It is believed that there exist deadlock patterns other than the circular dependency and the orphaned receive in MPI programs.
Future work will define other deadlock patterns and to detect deadlocks for these patterns. Also, future work will explore how to detect deadlocks for programs with branching.
