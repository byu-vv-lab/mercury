\section{Background}
This paper only considers non-determinism arising from message races and defines MPI program semantics in the context of concurrent trace programs (CTP) \cite[]. 
%In an MPI program, it is assumed that only non-blocking sends and receives are used. A non-blocking operation is issued without blocking the program execution. It is usually paired with a wait function that witnesses the completion of this non-blocking operation.
%% introduce the language aspects: non-blocking, blocking, barrier, collective, point-to-point in the introduction.
The syntax is in \figref{fig:expr:stx} (a). Tuples use white space rather than commas to delineate members, ellipses ($\ldots$) represent zero or more repetitions, and bold-face font denotes terminals in the language.

A CTP (\textit{ctp}) is a list of processes.  A process (\thread) is a list of commands. The commands (\textit{e}) are: non-blocking send (\sendi), non-blocking receive (\recvi), wait (\wait), and barrier (\barrier). 
The non-terminal \aid\ in the grammar is a unique string identifier \textbf{ID} associated with a receive, a send, or a wait. 
A receive indicates both its unique ID and the unique
ID of its associated wait. That wait by definition is its
nearest-enclosing wait (i.e., the first wait that witnesses the receive
complete).
%The MPI semantics use an infinite buffer, therefore, a non-block send is issued immediately. As such, it is not necessary to associate an identifier or a wait with the send. 
A barrier \barrier\ is also associated with an identifier that is unique for its communicator. The communicator identifies a group of barrier commands. Processes block at the barrier commands until all members in the communicator arrive.
The non-terminal \num\ in the grammar is used to denote endpoints, and it can be $\ast$ to indicate any endpoint. The receive and send commands include source and destination endpoints for communication. In the case of receive, the source may be $\ast$ indicating that the receive can match with any send to the same destination regardless of the source.

A pattern instance (\rcvp) is a tuple of IDs indicating unique receive commands. Each process has at most one
receive ID in the tuple. If a process has a receive ID in the tuple, then the receive attached to the ID marks a point of execution in
the owning process. The intuition is that if each process is able to
arrive at the indicated point of execution in the pattern instance, then a deadlock is imminent.


%\figref{fig:deadlock2} shows an example of a CTP with three processes. 

%Consider extending the syntax for data and computation so can use it for other errors
