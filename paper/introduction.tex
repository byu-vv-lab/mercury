\section{Introduction}
The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is widely used in high performance computing (HPC). A common problem in any MPI program, is communication deadlock. A communication deadlock is ``\emph{a situation in which each member process of the group is waiting for some member process to communicate with it, but no member is attempting to communicate with it}" \cite{DBLP:conf/fsttcs/Natarajan84}. This paper refers to a communication deadlock as deadlock. 

This paper considers only single-path MPI programs that are typical of many HPC applications and the standard for most deadlock analysis tools. The deadlock problem for a single-path MPI program is NP--Complete \cite{DBLP:conf/fm/ForejtKNS14}. There are two reasons that makes deadlocks in a single-path message passing program hard to detect. First, messages are communicated in a non-deterministic way such that a receive may be matched with more than one send in the runtime system. The collective operations such as barrier synchronize a program such that the semantics become more complicated. Second, the message communication is impacted by two buffering semantics: infinite buffer semantics (messages are buffered in the system) and zero buffer semantics (no buffering in the system). 

Several solutions have been proposed for deadlock detection. Dynamic analysis includes the POE algorithm that is capable of analyzing the behavior of MPI programs \cite{DBLP:conf/ppopp/VakkalankaSGK08}. This algorithm is implemented by a modern MPI verifier, ISP. An extension is the algorithm MSPOE that for MPI program deadlock detection \cite{DBLP:conf/sbmf/SharmaGB12}. 
%The problem can also be checked by SAT/SMT technique. 
Forejt et al. proposed a SAT based approach to detect deadlock in a single-path MPI program \cite{DBLP:conf/fm/ForejtKNS14}. As far as we know, these two approaches are the only existing works in message passing deadlock detection. Unfortunately, they do not scale well for several benchmark programs. This paper show the experimental results later. In the field of shared memory programs, Joshi et al. proposed a technique that uses a random thread scheduler to create the potential deadlocks that are detected by an imprecise dynamic analyzer \cite{DBLP:conf/pldi/JoshiPSN09}. This approach is able to check large multi-threaded programs and does not give any false warnings. 

This paper presents a new algorithm that is able to detect a deadlock for a single-path MPI program in three steps. First, the algorithm uses a static analyzer to detect a set of pattern instances by statically traversing the program. The algorithm then uses an abstract machine to prune provably non-feasible pattern instances from the set of potential deadlocks. If needed, the algorithm finally validates whether or not any remaining instances imply a real deadlock. Novel is that the abstract machine efficiently rejects non-feasible instances by simply counting the issued sends and receives, instead of exhaustively enumerating all message races. The complexity of the algorithm is quadratic. 

This paper further defines two distinct patterns of deadlock and their validations: circular dependency and orphaned receive. A circular dependency pattern may cause a program deadlock if there exists a cycle among a group of processes where a receive on each member process waits for the issuing of a send on another member process but never gets a response. An orphaned receive pattern may also cause a program deadlock if there exists a pair of a wildcard receive (a receive that may match a send from any source) and a deterministic receive (a receive that only matches a send from a fixed source) on an identical process. The deadlock occurs when the wildcard receive is matched with a send that should match the deterministic receive by the runtime. The paper also presents how to detect and validate the instances for each of the patterns above.

This paper additionally gives proofs that the general algorithm is sound and complete for the circular dependency pattern and that it is complete for the orphaned receive pattern. To make the algorithm sound for the orphaned receive pattern, a higher cost SMT encoding extended from the prior work (\cite{DBLP:conf/kbse/HuangMM13,HuangNFM15}) is required to identify a real deadlock in the remaining set of instances. As a note, the algorithm is designed for infinite buffer semantics. Nevertheless, it is adaptable to zero buffer semantics with a few changes in deadlock validation.

The contributions are summarized as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item The key contribution is an abstract machine that is able to efficiently prune non-feasible pattern instances from a set of potential deadlocks without false warnings; 
\item The second contribution is the definition of two typical patterns: circular dependency and orphaned receive, and their validations;
\item The third contribution is the implementation of the algorithm in the paper for MPI deadlock detection and a set of benchmarks that demonstrate it is more efficient than two state-of-art MPI verifiers.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 introduces a few notations and definitions for an MPI program; Section 3 presents the main framework of the technique in the paper with a soundness and completeness proof, Section 4 and 5 present the circular dependency pattern and the orphaned receive pattern with a few examples, the pattern matching algorithms and the validation algorithms; Section 6 gives the experimental results; Section 7 discusses the related work; and Section 8 discusses the conclusion and future work.
