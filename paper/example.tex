\section{Example}
Consider a CTP in \figref{fig:deadlock2} that includes three processes. This CTP uses sends and receives for message communication. Line numbers appear in the first column for each process. Picking up the scenario, the process $p_0$ sends a message to $p_1$, then receives a message from any source, and finally sends another message to $p_1$; the process $p_1$ receives two messages from any source in the receives $r_1$ and $r_2$, and then sends a message to $p_2$; the process $p_2$ receives a message from $p_1$ and then sends a message to $p_0$. The set of the underlined commands $(r_0,r_2,r_3)$ is a pattern instance where each command is set as a point on a single process. The pattern instance enforces that each process has at most one command in the instance.
