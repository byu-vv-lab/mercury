\figref{fig:deadlock2} is an example CTP with line numbers and underlined commands to indicate a pattern instance. Process $p_0$ sends a message to $p_1$, then receives a message from any source, and finally sends another message to $p_1$. Process $p_1$ receives two messages from any source in the receives $r_1$ and $r_2$, and then sends a message to $p_2$. Process $p_2$ receives a message from $p_1$ and then sends a message to $p_0$. The tuple $(r_0,r_2,r_3)$ is a pattern instance. If each process is able to arrive at these program points in some feasible execution, then the program contains the deadlock indicated by the pattern instance, which in this example, is a circular dependency.
