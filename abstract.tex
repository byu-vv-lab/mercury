A significant problem in any message passing program is deadlock. This paper presents a technique for detecting two common deadlock patterns in message passing programs: mismatch send-receive and circular dependency. The novelty is not detecting instances of these two deadlock patterns, but using a low-cost static analysis to first prune infeasible instances from the potential deadlocks, which is sufficient to identify real deadlock from circular dependency, and then using a higher-cost SMT encoding to identify real deadlock from mismatch send-receive. The approach is able to reason over infinite and zero buffer semantics for message passing programs. This paper proves the approach is sound and compares the approach with two other verifiers on typical benchmarks where the new approach completes the analysis while the others time-out. The comparison shows that the new approach is able to respond in milliseconds even when the program contains over $10^{257}$ possibilities for message communication.
